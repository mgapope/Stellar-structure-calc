Welcome, I am glad you took the time to look over my stellar structure code. Some notes on running the code
There's a few packages that must be installed for the code to work, all of them can be installed via pip

pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install mesa_reader
pip install pandas

The only other thing to note is the different opacity tables. For this repository, I've uploaded a few sample tables, and they're all stored under the OPACITIES folder.
